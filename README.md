# Minitest::Redgreen

This is proof of concept of colorizing minitest output. I'm pretty sure
there are already gems for doing this. This was only an exercise.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'minitest-redgreen'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install minitest-redgreen

## Usage

Add this line to your application's test_helper.rb or spec_helper.rb:

    require 'minitest/redgreen'

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
